# CodeDrills: Instructor Guide

## Exercise Structure

Each exercise should have:
- `README.md` - Instructions for students
- Solution file (e.g., `solution.py`) - Template code
- Test file (e.g., `test_solution.py`) - Tests to validate solutions

Example structure:
```text
exercise_name/ 
├── README.md 
├── solution.py 
└── test_solution.py
```

## Creating Good Exercises

1. **Clear Instructions**: Start with a descriptive heading and concise problem statement
2. **Function Signature**: Define exactly what students should implement
3. **Examples**: Include sample inputs and outputs
4. **Test Cases**: Write tests for normal use and edge cases

## Organizing Multiple Exercises

Arrange exercises in a logical progression, from basic to advanced concepts:
```text
course-folder/ 
├── 01-basics/ 
├── 02-data-structures/ 
└── 03-algorithms/
```
